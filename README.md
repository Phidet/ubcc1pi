# ubcc1pi
A package for the selection and analysis of charged current single pion muon neutrino interactions in MicroBooNE

## Overview
This repository contains code which can be run in LArSoft or as a standalone package. The LArSoft component is used to exctract relevant
information from art ROOT files. This information can either be persisted to a lightweight analysis ROOT file for standalone analysis, or be
analysed within the LArSoft framework. The actual physics logic of the analysis is factored out and doesn't depend on LArSoft at all.

## Installation
See [here](INSTALLME.md) for installation instructions.
