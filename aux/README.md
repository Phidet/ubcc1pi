# Auxiliary code

In this directory, you will find code that runs on top of the output root files from the analyzers (e.g. plotting macros)
The code in this subdirectory isn't compiled as part of the package, but is provided here for convenience.

The [/aux/grid/](grid) directory contains the scripts required to run the compiled code on the Fermi grid system
